when i leave.. either for the day or forever.. it is always strange seeing them

They look and I look away, how dare they ask for eye contact when they
wouldnt show me common decency when we were forced in a room
together

i go back in the car when i see someone from there, and i think about
killing them :::: I think about killing a lot of people, i think about
strapping them to a chair and beating their face into a pulp with
an aluminum bat. ive decided she doesnt deserve beauty
