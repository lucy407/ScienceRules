its an interesting paradox

women im not interested in tell me to be open with my emotions
they say its wrong that boys dont express their sadness and vulnerability
but the women who might consider me absolutely hate it. they think
im a freak when i communicate any desire beside generosity

the world of the living is a game of paddleball...
guess whos the ball
