I recall watching the news after VT happened last april

between the rambles of gun control an NRA member looked into the
camera as if he was trying to talk to kids like me, im paraphrasing:
"if you are a student and feel alone, threatened, frightened, or inferior..
lashing out at the world with fatal violence like this is not the answer"

I dont want to kill them because im lonely, they just need a wake up call.
most classes I sit alone, no one speaks to me. last week a girl who gets
plenty of attention for her looks was venting to the teacher about how
she didnt fit in.. mentioning she only knew her boyfriend and thats it...
isnt that great irony? im lightyears from getting anything close to a girlfriend,
she sees no one talks to me, yet vents right in front of me about how little
she has socially.

I am not jealous, just sick of the ignorance she and many others exhibit.
their cozy little world, I want to destroy it. 
I want to destroy it and look them in the eye while I do it.
I want them to remember me.
