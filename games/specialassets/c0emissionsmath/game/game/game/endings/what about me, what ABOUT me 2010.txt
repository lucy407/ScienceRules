they all run off after getting their diplomas
as the months go by I slowly start to realize they didnt talk to me
and laugh at everything I said because they liked me, they did
it to pass the time while they felt trapped in walls of boredom

this was the real world as I now knew it, not even admissions offices
humored me without any extra curriculor clubs on my transcript...
no one would ever let me in one. I have been working at a gas station
to pass the time. Someone who laughed at me in school pulled up
with a fancy car, trying to avoid eye contact as much as they could.

do they feel guilty? or maybe just past the point of looking for comic relief
I guess 45 seconds at the pump isn't enough time for novelties like me
